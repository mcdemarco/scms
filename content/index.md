# SCMS

SCMS opens a file named `index.md` when you browse to a directory.

You can configure it to open a different filename and/or file extension (*e.g.,* `notes.txt`),
so you don't need to rename any files.

You can also configure it to open a file at random when no default file was found (TODO).

Read more about it in the [README](readme).
