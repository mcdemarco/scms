# The index file

SCMS loads a file named `index.md` when you browse to a directory and displays the text or markdown content as HTML.
You can configure it to open a different filename and/or file extension (*e.g.,* `notes.txt`),
so you don't need to rename any files.

## Randomness

You can also configure it to open a file at random from the current directory when there's no file with the default name.  Random theming is also available.

## Help

Read more about configuration in the [README](readme).
